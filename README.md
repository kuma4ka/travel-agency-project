## Project Description:
Final group project assignment for "Algorithms and Methods of Programming" course.

## Assignment Description

- You are placed in a maze with a starting point S.

- You need to find your way to goal G AS QUICKLY(as few cells as possible) AS POSSIBLE and collect some coins on the way.

- Walls are X, and each cell in a passage has some coins 0 to 9.

- Moves are 1 unit each.

- You are ALLOWED TO MOVE DIAGONALLY 

- The outside maze is lava.

## Example
```
G503746 
0XXXXX4 
3XS6138 
3XXXXXX 
1X19736 
5XXXXX8 
3375042
```

Solution is  6+1+3+(we skip 8 since we move diagonally)+4+(we skip 6 since we move diagonally)+4+7+3+0+5== 33
